title: Spell Check for VS Code
---

Trying to setup so I can get a replacement for 
misspelled words like Privilege.

This one took waaaaay longer than expected. But, that's how it goes sometimes. 

It's time well spent. This is getting my editor setup so that I don't have to worry about it. 

The extension I used in the video is:

    Spell Right     

The command to do the fix is "Quick Fix..." which I can hotkey with:

    Command + .

I decided to change over to use the extension:

    Code Spell Checker

It has over 2million installs vs. Spell Right which has closer to 200K. Spell Right was doing that I needed, but there might be a reason folks use Code Spell Checker more. (That reason might just be because it's been around longer, but I'm going with the crowd on this one)
