title: Making A Checklist
---

Overview
--------

Creating a basic checklist that I'll use to get setup to make a video. 

Notes
-----

I mentioned radio buttons but forgot to talk about them. Here's another video that talks about the difference (TKTKTKTK radio buttons vs checkboxes).

I missed changing the ids for the checkboxes and the labels the first time through. Oops. I caught it when I started to use the checklist. So, there's a quick addendum showing where I goofed and the fix.

After the stream I did a few CSS enhancements to up the font size and space the lines out a little.
