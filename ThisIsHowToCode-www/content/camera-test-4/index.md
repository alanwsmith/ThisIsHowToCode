- Canon 90D clean HDMI feed 
- Canon 16-35mm lens at about 18mm
- f/3.5 - 1/50 with auto ISO (which seems to do great, but will probably lock into a specific at some point)
- White balance locked at 5200K. 
- Canon 90D thru Elgato Cam Link into OBS at 1920x1080 with 1920x1080 canvas. 
- Desktop into OBS via Elgato 4K60 Pro mk. II. at 38x40x2160 (System Preferences display says 1920x1080, but it's really 4K). 
- Desktop Transform in OBS is:

    - Size X: 5120
    - Size Y: 2880
    - Crop Right: 480 
    - Crop Bottom: 270

- This one isn't really about fonts, but VS Code is set to:

    - Font Size: 15
    - Line Height: 19
    - Window Zoom: 3

- Edit via DaVinci Resolve 17
- Using my old Munsell Color x-right color checker with DaVinci set to "x-rite ColorCheker Classic - Legacy"
- The Green Screen filter ended up on top of the x-rite so a few of the colors punch through 
- Still tweaked the colors a little. 
- Going to be using different lights so not worried about it to much, but it looks really solid. 
- Desktop shift in DaVinci Resolve:

    - Zoom X&Y: .94
    - Position X: -110
    - Position Y: 60

- No crop on the main headshot 
- Lower corner headshot:

    - Zoom X&Y: .38
    - Position X: 1498
    - Position Y: -745
    - Not that this cuts off some of the bottom part of the image, but that helps lower things so they don't conflict but keeps the size reasonable

- Drop Shadow on the desktop is the "Resolve FX Stylize" with the default settings: 

    - Shadow Strength: .5
    - Drop Angle: 37.5
    - Drop Distance: 0.05
    - Blur: 0.55
    - Global blend: 1.0
    - Use Alpha: Checked (true)

- Transitions are basic Cross Dissolve changed to 0.3 sec and with Ease In&Out
