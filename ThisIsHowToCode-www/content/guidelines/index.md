### Environment

- Set Windows display zoom to 350% on 4K monitor to increase size of the UI elements and text
- Set Windows to Nithlight mode so the color temperature matches the studio lights

### Apps

- Use bases of black text on white backgrounds
- Font size height of ??? (TKTKTK determine hight based of UI elements of phones)
- Setup syntax highlighting to have high contrast
- Minimize secondary UI elements
- Eliminate pop-up tooltips
- Work full screen with each app

### Examples

- Cut examples to a bare minimum
- Use semantic HTML for full examples
- Use the same name sets in examples

### How-Tos

- These are for folks who know what they are doing and are looking for a specific answer
- Do basic setup proior to recording so you can jump right in
- Just show a single path through (i.e. don't spent time talking about alternate approaches)

### Tutorials

- These are for folks who are new to the subject matter
- Start completely from scratch (e.g. don't have the app open or any basic setup already done)
- Only show one path through (i.e. don't discuss alternatives as that will just add mental overhead to new folks)
