Things I've done for the setup:

- System Preferences -> Display -> Cursor Size = up about halfway. see screenshot

- VS Code:

    - Window: Zoom Level = 3
    - Editor: Font Family = Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace
    - Editor: Font Size = 15
    - Editor: Line Height = 19

    This enlarges the entire UI to make it easier to read.

    Also updated the theme font to make it pure black.

- Click Highlighting:

    - "Presentation Assistant" from the Mac App Store ($2.99)
