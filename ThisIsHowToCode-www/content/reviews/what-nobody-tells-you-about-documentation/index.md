From the video:

- Documentation isn't just one thing. It's four:

    - Tutorials
    - How-To Guides
    - Discussions
    - Reference 

- Documentation needs to be expliciltly structured around one of the four categories 

- Folks need each type at different times 

- They need to be kept distinct 

- Tutorials:

    - Learning oriented 
    - Detailed walk-thrus to complete a project 
    - Targted at beginners
    - Show them how to acheive something meaningful 
    - Hardest part to create and maintain

- Tutorials - What Matters:

    - Learning By Doing
    - Getting Started
    - Inspiring Confidence
    - Repeatability 
    - Immediate Sense of Achievement
    - Concreteness (Not Abstraction)
    - Specific (Not General)
    - Minimum Necessary Explination 
    - No Distractions (don't throw in options, you're the teacher, you design the arc)
    - The learner doesn't know the problems to be solved (you decide what to do)

- How-To Guides

    - Problem oriented
    - Guides through the steps required to complete a common problem 
    - They get confused with Tutorials all the time
    - Think recipies 

- How-To Guides - What Matters:

    - A series of steps
    - A focus on the goal
    - Address a specific question 
    - No unnecessary explination
    - A little flexibility
    - Practicle usability 
    - Good naming 
    - The user/learner has enough knowledge that they've identified the problem to solve (as compared to the tutorail learner where they don't know how to formulate the problem)

- Reference 

    - Information oriented 
    - Technical descriptions
    - The one job is description 
    - List and describe things
    - Can include examples, but don't explain basic concepts
    - Explination, discussion, and discussion would be disctractions (not sure I agree with this toally, but probably mostly, like explination via examples might be nice)

- Reference - What Matters

    - Structred 
    - Consistent 
    - Descriptive 
    - Accurate


- Discussions 

    - Understanding oriented 
    - Explinations that clarify and illuminate a topic 


- Discussion - What Matters

    - Giving context
    - Explaining why
    - Multiple examples
    - Alternative approaches
    - Making connections
    - No instruction or technical description (this one throws me a little)


Quadrants

- Tutorials:
    - Practial Steps
    - Most useful when studying 
- How-To Guides:
    - Pratcial Steps
    - Most useful when coding
- Reference
    - Most useful when coding
    - Theoretical knowledge 
- Discussion
    - Theoretical knowledge
    - Most useful when studying






- Quotes:

    - Explination doesn't matter when somebody is learning a new skill. What they need to learn is "to do".
