title: Building The Site (Part 5)
---

We got a web site live!

Well, it's just a page and it's not on the domain we want and it's not secure, but it's live!

We setup basic hosting on Amazon S3. The goal is to use CloudFront and that's where we started, but this turned out to be a good first step. A test just to make sure the pipes are working and to get us moving. 

Next steps are in the next video. 

The example index.html file we used is in the example_index_file directory.

NOTE: As I mention in the preface, it's possible to use S3 *without* making the bucket public. This is done by setting it up with an S3 API Endpoint. Check out this video for how to do that along with getting the rest of the site setup.
