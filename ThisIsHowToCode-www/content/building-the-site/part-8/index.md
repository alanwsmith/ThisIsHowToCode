title: Building The Site (Part 8)
---

### Overview

- I decided to change the name of the project from:

        This Is How You Program
    
    To:

        This Is How You Code  

- This is me registering the website domain name 





### Details

Up to this point, I've been calling this project. This Is How You Program. Recording on of the episodes, I said "This Is How You Code" and immediately realized that's a better name. 

Registering a domain on Amazon's Route 53 was on the list of videos to produce. Making the switch to "ThisIsHowYouCode.com" fit that bill perfectly and will give me a chance to walk through the process much faster. 

This one is the registration itself. Getting the result of the parts (S3, CloudFront, and Certificate Manager) setup is in the next one. 




Registering The Domain:

    ThisIsHowYouCode.com
