Well, the camera works, but the Cam Link doesn't work for me. My computer can't process fast enough to use it at 4K. So, falling back to 1080... Bummer. 

Here's a test at 1080 just make sure things work. 

A little preview of a future session where I'll parse out datatime stamps from when files were created to add dates to the site files that are missing them.
