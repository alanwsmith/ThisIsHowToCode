This is where I setup a windows machine. 

Kinda tedious. Probably skip it if I were you. 




This one is just installing stuff. I wouldn't be offended if you just skipped it. 

- Installed VS Code
- Installed the command line version of Git
- Cloned down the git repo for ThisIsHowToCode 
- And installed Hugo in a special bonus
