This is what I'm looking at for the introduction video:


TODO: Make different versions of this with different analogys, like using legos, then cooking stuff, then... sports stuff?

DRAFT:

Hey, folks.

My name is Alan. For the last 25 years, I've used what I've learned from other folks to build a successful coding career that's been better than most people can dream of. Now, it's time for me to give back. So, I'm building this site to teach you to code. 

If you've never touched a computer before, don't worry, you don't need one to understand the basics. And what's amazing is there's only three things you need to learn to started. There's like legos. The little blocks that are simple by themselves but can make amazing things when put together. 

Those three things are: the question "if", loops, and vairables.
