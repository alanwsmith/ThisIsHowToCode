### Overview

- Installed the 2700K LED bulbs. Much easier on the eyes
- Bulbs are about 1/2 stop brighter
- This one is all about checking different camera positions
- Monitor is at the same height for each camera test (TKTKTK Confirm this is the case when you're done with the test)
- Might end up cutting off some of the background for the left and right sides views since the green screen doesn't wrap the entire room
- VS Code
    - Editor - Font Size: 15
    - Editor - Line Height: 19
    - Window - Zoom Level: 3



### Color Balance Prep 

- Lights say they are 2700K
- Camera White Balance: 2700K
- Exposure setting based off Sekonic L-308S:
    - ISO: 800
    - 1/60
    - f/3.5
- Highlight is f/4.1 on my right
- Background is pretty even f/4.0


- [x] Hold up color board (x-rite: Mini ColorChecker Card P/N 50111 (that's probably 10 years old...))
