----------------------------------------------

- (You're not supposed to read your slides, but....)

- I want to make sure my videos are as accessible as
    possible. This includes making them viewable at 
    standard phone sizes.

- This session is a test to check the effect of resolution 
    on readability.

- The font sizes have been chosen to put ~20 lines on in
    the editor. That's my current starting point to test 
    for phone legibility.

- The samples come from a 2015 13" MacBook Pro going through 
    an Elgato 4K60 Pro Mk.2 into OBS.

- OBS is set to capture 4K. Base and output both 3840x2160.

- The monitor the Elgato outputs to is 4K. I don't know if 
    that matters. It might be what triggers the mac to send 
    hi-res signals.

- The samples are of the full screen.

- The four resolutions tested are: 
    - 720p
    - 1280x720
    - 1080p
    - 1920x1080
    
- The 720p and 1080p resolutions come across natively and
    look blurry to me on the 4K monitor

- The mac bumps the 1280x720 and 1920x1080 resolutions
    to hi-res. They look sharp to me on the 4K monitor. 
    I don't know if the 1280x720 does 4x resolution, but 
    it looks like it might based off the clarity.

- 1280x720 looks way better than 1080p on the monitor

- When the font sizes adjusted to be the same relative 
    height there's very little difference between 1280x720 
    and 1920x1080. (I think there's a little difference,
    but I'm not entirely sure. Either way, it's very close)

- The trick with 1280x720 vs 1920x1080 is all the font sizes 
    you can't change (like menus and UI controls)

- If you're not on a hi-res screen I don't know if you'll
    be able to see the difference. (I kinda doubt it.)

- Note that the 1920x1080 option under Displays did not 
    show up for me by default. I had to "Option + Click"
    on "Scaled" to get it to show up.

- It doesn't matter for coding, but the refresh rates 
    for the different resolutions are.

    - 720p
        - 50 (used, default option)
        - 60

    - 1280x720
        - 60 (used, only option)
    
    - 1080p 
        - 24
        - 25
        - 30 
        - 50
        - 60 (used, default option)
        - 100
        - 120 

    - 1920x1080
        - 24
        - 25
        - 30 (used, default option)
