Overview 
--------

- I want to add dates to my posts, but I don't want the date to be a distraction
- I setup a Text Expander snippet to produce a epoch seconds timestamp
- I got super confused and thrown off by a sample of code 
- After the first take, I did dug in and figured out I was right. Seconds since epoch is always the same.




### Code 

The Text Expander Code we ended up with turned out to be this super straight forward line:

{{< highlight javascript "linenos=table" >}}
Math.round( Date.now() / 1000);
{{< /highlight >}}
