The sizing of fonts is a difficult matter. Independent of streaming and recording, I'd go with a 14pt font on my 4K monitor. In VS Code, that gives me TKTKTK cols by TKTKTK rows. Crisp. Tons of room. Just right.

Unfortunately, that won't work when you throw live coding into the mix. 



That won't work when you add coding on video into the mix. 





That size is perfect for me but would be hard to see when put into a video window on lots of displays and impossible to see on others.
