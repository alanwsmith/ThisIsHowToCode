title: Elgato Cam Link 4K Is A No Go

This is a test of the Elgato Cam Link. 

- There's a Canon 90D plugged into it with Clean HDMI signal
- It was connected to my Early 2015 13" MacBook Pro 
- Obviously, the CPU can't keep up. 

The Elgato site says you need a 4th generation i5 or better. That certainly wasn't clear on purchase. 

I use a 4K60 Pro Mk. II for recording the desktop. It works great. I thought the Cam Link would work the same way, but that's not the case. It needs the CPU horse power do the work that the 4K60 does.
