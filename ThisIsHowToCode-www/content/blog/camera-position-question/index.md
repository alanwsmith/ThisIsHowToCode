title: Camera Position Question

I've been exploring Premiere and After Effects and green screen keying. I've made a lot of progress and have a couple more softboxes coming in to help even more. (Basically every post about green screen keying says get your light right or you're in for a world of hurt)

While thinking about the green screen and the new camera that's on the way I started thinking about camera angles. I've already pushed my monitor farther away from me that I'd normally use it so that I can enlarge the fonts to make them readable on small screens. 

So, I'm thinking I can push it even farther back and use a longer lense to help make keying easier. 

while thinking about that, I got to thinking about the camera angle. Or, placement, rather. It's sitting on top of the monitor. That means, whenever I'm looking at the screen, I'm looking down. I wonder what it would look like if the camera was below the monitor. Since I frame myself up on the bottom of the screen it might actually work nicely.

Something to experiment with.
