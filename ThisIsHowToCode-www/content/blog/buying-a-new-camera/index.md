Bought a new camera last night. 

Unfortunately, my old Canon 5D Mk III doesn't do auto-focus during while shooting video. Also, it only shoot 1080p. I want 4K. 

4K is overkill for what I'm doing right now. But, I'm thinking long term. Like 20 years long term. I want to get the best available now so that as tech progresses, it holds up as well as possible. 

I've spent a bunch of money over the past few weeks on gear. I've been wanting a new mac for a while, but they are so very expensive. But, I finally took the plunge based off wanting to work more efficiently with the videos I'm making. Turns out that I'll also need another machine to do recording. 

My base setup is going to be:

• Mac that I work off of, plugged into an elgato 4K capture card in the windows machine
• Windows machine with the capture card will record the desktop in OBS cropped in to just the portion of the screen that provides a good balance of size and readability from large to smaller devices
• Mic plugged into windows machine too which will also be picked up by OBS
• Old mac will be connected to the camera via an elgato cam link to record that video

I'll sync up the recordings in Adobe Premiere. It does an amazing job syncing off the audio. Very cool. 

I'm also thinking about a way to broadcast on twitch while I do the recordings. I don't want to mess with the version of OBS doing the clean recording of my desktop, but I could pipe the signal through another capture card on another computer and addable a twitch view there. A little off-beat, but I'm gonna give it a shot since I still have the old non-4k elgato capture card. 

For the face cam, I'll just use my current logitech cam  that'll be replaced by the new camera (which is a Canon 90D, btw). 

Using the second OBS will also let me post a message that I'm not looking at chat while I'm doing the recordings. Then I can turn that off and chat with folks when the main recording is done. (I'm still not totally sure about this. I may just have twitch sessions? I'm not sure what the right play is here yet, but we'll figure it out.)

Anyway, progress is making progress and I'm closer to getting a solid setup. And, looking back at all the stuff I've shot so far, it'll be just fine even if it's not as high a quality. In face, it'll be kinda neat (at least for me) to see the progression as things improve.
