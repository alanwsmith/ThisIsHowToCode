title: JavaScript Timer
---

This is our JavaScript Timer. It's what I use to
keep track of time when recording videos. The
basic details are:

- The timer starts when the page is opened
- The number displayed only updates every 300 seconds (which is 5 minutes)
- The way we do this is by using the `%` operator. It gives us the remainder of one number divided by another. Using this, we can see when the remainder of our target number is zero and know that we hit something that divides by it directly. We then use that zero for the indicator of when we should update our display. 
- Note that I did some cleanup of the timer function and file after the video to remove kruft. The functionality is all still the same. (You can grab the version from the end of the video in the repo)
