title: Setting Up An AWS Account
---

Overview
--------

This video is about getting started with an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account. You'll need a credit card, phone number, and email address. 

The first thing to setup is a "Root" account. It has the power to do everything. It is _THE_ main account. Because it's so powerful, you actually don't use it for much. Instead you create other user accounts in the AWS Identity and Access Management (also know as IAM) service and use them. 

In the video, I setup an AWS account with a Root user. Then I that Root account to create two other accounts that I'll actually use. One that has Administrator privileges via the web console and another one that can only access the S3 file storage service via the command line.  

Next step is to setup Multi-Factor Authentication for that non-root accounts and get the command line account configured so I can actually use it. That's [the next video](/tktktk/)
