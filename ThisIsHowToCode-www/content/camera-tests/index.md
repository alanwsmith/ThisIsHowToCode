Video Test 1
------------

- GoPro - 30fps
- OBS - 30fps

Won't really be using the GoPro. This is really more about practicing with the green screen lighting and keying.

Everything looks pretty good. Need to do a little more on the color balance and on the edges. I've got another set of soft boxes coming in to get more even light on the green screen which should help. I'll also be switching to a canon 90D which will let me use a longer lens that'll help too.
