        <p>
            Overview Started to build the deployer in the last session but found an issue where links weren&rsquo;t working. Now that that&rsquo;s solved, it&rsquo;s back to the deployer.
 EDIT: Points about 10:40 and some beffore when it showed the Access Key. Check all termial hits.
Make sure to edit out when you fire up keychain access.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            Started off by building a deployer but then discovered our index.html files weren&rsquo;t showing up. Fix is a Lambda@Edge function that looks for calls that need to add the files and adds them.
Was thinking about trying to remove the trailing slashes, but that&rsquo;s begging for problems. Also, realized that it would take hacking Hugo itself to deal with removing the slashes since it puts them in the URLs when it makes them.

            The Plan  Finish moving in content to be served by Hugo  The Result  Got stuck working with sub directories. Files wouldn&rsquo;t output where expected. Did some troubleshooting by switching Hugo to actually build the site with the plain hugo command instead of serving it from memory with hugo server. This let me look in the public directory at the files that were actually output. Finally figured out that if there&rsquo;s a subfolder that you want content rendered it, the folder above has to contain and _index.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            We got a web site live!
Well, it&rsquo;s just a page and it&rsquo;s not on the domain we want and it&rsquo;s not secure, but it&rsquo;s live!
We setup basic hosting on Amazon S3. The goal is to use CloudFront and that&rsquo;s where we started, but this turned out to be a good first step. A test just to make sure the pipes are working and to get us moving.
Next steps are in the next video.

        <p>
            Notes Amazon changes their web console all the time. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if things look different and you have to search for them a little.
The Plan  Get the site served via CloudFront over HTTPS.  The Details   Started off by showing where we left off with an S3 bucket being served out directly via it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Static website hosting&rdquo; option property. We turned that off since we only want traffic to be able to hit the bucket via CloudFront.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            Overview I registered the ThisIsHowYouProgram.com domain on Hover. I already had an account there and when I woke up at 3 in the morning with the idea for the site that&rsquo;s where I went.
But, I want to use Amazon&rsquo;s Route 53 service to manage the domain so that everything is in the AWS ecosystem. Route 53 is designed to work with CloudFront in a way that other systems can&rsquo;t (via an ALIAS record)
