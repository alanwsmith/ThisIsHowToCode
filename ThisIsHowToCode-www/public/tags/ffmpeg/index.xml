      <description>Picking up where we left off.
Got a PowerShell script setup that watches a specific folder and runs an ffmpeg command to process any gif files and place them in a new directory before deleting the original.
This was my first time using PowerShell to script something. It&amp;rsquo;s very different from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to, but I can see the appeal. Definitely going to take some getting used to.

      <description>TODO: Get ImageMagik installed and test the conversion in this answer https://superuser.com/a/556031/85635
I used GIF Brewery to make GIFs on my Mac. Since moving to Windows, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a good replacement&amp;hellip; Until now.
In this session, I figure out how to get Adobe Premiere to setup the loop and then export an initial cropped file. Running that through ffmpeg give me a nice quality GIF at whatever size I specify.</description>
