      <description>Picking up where we left off.
Got a PowerShell script setup that watches a specific folder and runs an ffmpeg command to process any gif files and place them in a new directory before deleting the original.
This was my first time using PowerShell to script something. It&amp;rsquo;s very different from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to, but I can see the appeal. Definitely going to take some getting used to.

      <description>Overview Took two hours to figure out how to get a script to run. Now I can acutally try to do something with them.
This is a lot of me looking at other code and documentation to try to figure out how to do what I&amp;rsquo;m after. There&amp;rsquo;s very little online about this. Depending on what I find, it has me thinking about Adobe scripting. Setting a greenscreen was much easier on DaVinci, but if I only have to define it once in Adobe and can script it.</description>
