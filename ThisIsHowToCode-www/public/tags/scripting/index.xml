      <description>Picking up where we left off.
Got a PowerShell script setup that watches a specific folder and runs an ffmpeg command to process any gif files and place them in a new directory before deleting the original.
This was my first time using PowerShell to script something. It&amp;rsquo;s very different from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to, but I can see the appeal. Definitely going to take some getting used to.
