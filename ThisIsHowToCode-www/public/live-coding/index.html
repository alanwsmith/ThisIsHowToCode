        <p>
            I&rsquo;m not sure how I ended up on the path, but I used to jump through a bunch of hoops to capture both STDOUT and STDERR from Python&rsquo;s subprocess modules. As of 3.7, it&rsquo;s straight forward with the capture_output. It&rsquo;s as easy as:
response = subprocess.run(['PROCESS_TO_RUN'], capture_output=True) The values are in:
response.stdoutandresponse.stderr The values are encoded and generally have a newline at the end of them. So you&rsquo;ll want to access them with something like:

Cut the video about 15-20 min before the end since you were just hanging out.

            Picking up where we left off.
Got a PowerShell script setup that watches a specific folder and runs an ffmpeg command to process any gif files and place them in a new directory before deleting the original.
This was my first time using PowerShell to script something. It&rsquo;s very different from what I&rsquo;m used to, but I can see the appeal. Definitely going to take some getting used to.

I used GIF Brewery to make GIFs on my Mac. Since moving to Windows, I haven&rsquo;t found a good replacement&hellip; Until now.
In this session, I figure out how to get Adobe Premiere to setup the loop and then export an initial cropped file. Running that through ffmpeg give me a nice quality GIF at whatever size I specify.

Picking up where we left off in part 2, trying to see what we can do with the automation.
  made a help_text.py file that dumps out the output stuff. need to compare it to the read me to see if there&rsquo;s more stuff in it.
  it doesn&rsquo;t look like there&rsquo;s a way to add tracks via a script.

            Overview Took two hours to figure out how to get a script to run. Now I can acutally try to do something with them.
This is a lot of me looking at other code and documentation to try to figure out how to do what I&rsquo;m after. There&rsquo;s very little online about this. Depending on what I find, it has me thinking about Adobe scripting. Setting a greenscreen was much easier on DaVinci, but if I only have to define it once in Adobe and can script it.
