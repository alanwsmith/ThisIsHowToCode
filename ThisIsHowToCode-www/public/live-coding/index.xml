      <description>(Note: I&amp;rsquo;m using a new keyboard in this one, so there, a bunch of me banging around)
Picking up where we left off in part 2, trying to see what we can do with the automation.
  made a help_text.py file that dumps out the output stuff. need to compare it to the read me to see if there&amp;rsquo;s more stuff in it.
  it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like there&amp;rsquo;s a way to add tracks via a script.</description>

      <description>Overview Took two hours to figure out how to get a script to run. Now I can acutally try to do something with them.
This is a lot of me looking at other code and documentation to try to figure out how to do what I&amp;rsquo;m after. There&amp;rsquo;s very little online about this. Depending on what I find, it has me thinking about Adobe scripting. Setting a greenscreen was much easier on DaVinci, but if I only have to define it once in Adobe and can script it.</description>
