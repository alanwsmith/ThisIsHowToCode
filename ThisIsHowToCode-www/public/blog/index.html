        <p>
            This is a test of the Elgato Cam Link.
 There&rsquo;s a Canon 90D plugged into it with Clean HDMI signal It was connected to my Early 2015 13&quot; MacBook Pro Obviously, the CPU can&rsquo;t keep up.  The Elgato site says you need a 4th generation i5 or better. That certainly wasn&rsquo;t clear on purchase.
I use a 4K60 Pro Mk. II for recording the desktop. It works great. I thought the Cam Link would work the same way, but that&rsquo;s not the case.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been exploring Premiere and After Effects and green screen keying. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress and have a couple more softboxes coming in to help even more. (Basically every post about green screen keying says get your light right or you&rsquo;re in for a world of hurt)
While thinking about the green screen and the new camera that&rsquo;s on the way I started thinking about camera angles. I&rsquo;ve already pushed my monitor farther away from me that I&rsquo;d normally use it so that I can enlarge the fonts to make them readable on small screens.

            Dec. 6, 2020
Bought a new camera last night.
Unfortunately, my old Canon 5D Mk III doesn&rsquo;t do auto-focus during while shooting video. Also, it only shoot 1080p. I want 4K.
4K is overkill for what I&rsquo;m doing right now. But, I&rsquo;m thinking long term. Like 20 years long term. I want to get the best available now so that as tech progresses, it holds up as well as possible.
