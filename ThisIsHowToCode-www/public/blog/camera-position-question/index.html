<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring Premiere and After Effects and green screen keying. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress and have a couple more softboxes coming in to help even more. (Basically every post about green screen keying says get your light right or you&rsquo;re in for a world of hurt)</p>
<p>While thinking about the green screen and the new camera that&rsquo;s on the way I started thinking about camera angles. I&rsquo;ve already pushed my monitor farther away from me that I&rsquo;d normally use it so that I can enlarge the fonts to make them readable on small screens.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m thinking I can push it even farther back and use a longer lense to help make keying easier.</p>
<p>while thinking about that, I got to thinking about the camera angle. Or, placement, rather. It&rsquo;s sitting on top of the monitor. That means, whenever I&rsquo;m looking at the screen, I&rsquo;m looking down. I wonder what it would look like if the camera was below the monitor. Since I frame myself up on the bottom of the screen it might actually work nicely.</p>
<p>Something to experiment with.</p>
