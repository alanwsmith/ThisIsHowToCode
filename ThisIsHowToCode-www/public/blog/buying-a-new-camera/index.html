		<p>Dec. 6, 2020</p>
<p>Bought a new camera last night.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my old Canon 5D Mk III doesn&rsquo;t do auto-focus during while shooting video. Also, it only shoot 1080p. I want 4K.</p>
<p>4K is overkill for what I&rsquo;m doing right now. But, I&rsquo;m thinking long term. Like 20 years long term. I want to get the best available now so that as tech progresses, it holds up as well as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a bunch of money over the past few weeks on gear. I&rsquo;ve been wanting a new mac for a while, but they are so very expensive. But, I finally took the plunge based off wanting to work more efficiently with the videos I&rsquo;m making. Turns out that I&rsquo;ll also need another machine to do recording.</p>
<p>My base setup is going to be:</p>
<p>• Mac that I work off of, plugged into an elgato 4K capture card in the windows machine
• Windows machine with the capture card will record the desktop in OBS cropped in to just the portion of the screen that provides a good balance of size and readability from large to smaller devices
• Mic plugged into windows machine too which will also be picked up by OBS
• Old mac will be connected to the camera via an elgato cam link to record that video</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sync up the recordings in Adobe Premiere. It does an amazing job syncing off the audio. Very cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about a way to broadcast on twitch while I do the recordings. I don&rsquo;t want to mess with the version of OBS doing the clean recording of my desktop, but I could pipe the signal through another capture card on another computer and addable a twitch view there. A little off-beat, but I&rsquo;m gonna give it a shot since I still have the old non-4k elgato capture card.</p>
<p>For the face cam, I&rsquo;ll just use my current logitech cam  that&rsquo;ll be replaced by the new camera (which is a Canon 90D, btw).</p>
<p>Using the second OBS will also let me post a message that I&rsquo;m not looking at chat while I&rsquo;m doing the recordings. Then I can turn that off and chat with folks when the main recording is done. (I&rsquo;m still not totally sure about this. I may just have twitch sessions? I&rsquo;m not sure what the right play is here yet, but we&rsquo;ll figure it out.)</p>
<p>Anyway, progress is making progress and I&rsquo;m closer to getting a solid setup. And, looking back at all the stuff I&rsquo;ve shot so far, it&rsquo;ll be just fine even if it&rsquo;s not as high a quality. In face, it&rsquo;ll be kinda neat (at least for me) to see the progression as things improve.</p>
