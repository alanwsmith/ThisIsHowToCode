          <p>My name is Alan. For twenty-five years I've used what I learned from other folks to build a successful career writing code. Now, it's time for me to give back. For the next twenty-five, I'm builing this site into a free, comprehensice way to learn how to code. </p>

            <h3>There's Nothing Here...</h3>
            <p>Well, not much. I started the site Dec. 19th, 2020. The reason you're seeing it so early (and with no instructional videos yet) is that I'm coding it in public. Showing what it's like to build a project like this from scratch. It's like a Digital Garden where I'm inviting you in while I'm still tilling the soil.</p>

          <p>This first video isn't instructdional. </p>
          <p>There are going to be a few differetn types of videos: Fundamentals, Tutorials, How-Tos, and Live Coding. Right now, all the videos are Live Coding showing me building the site and getting everything setup. This is the first vidoe in that series. </p>
          <p>This isn't the first instructual video. It's the first in the series where I show the behind the scenes of building the site. </p>
          <p>I didn't really mean it to be that much of an introduction, but that's what it turned into.</p>

              <li>Everything here is 100% free.</li>
              <li>There won't be any ads. Ads may have their place, but it's not in education.</li>
              <li>There won't be invasive tracking. I'll collect some metrics to maintian the site but it will be as anonymous as possible.</li>
              <li>The content is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">licensed</a> so you can do pretty much anything you want with it except sell it.</li>
              <li>There will be no requirement to sign up. You can use the site completely anonymously with no hassle. (There will eventually be user accounts that make it easier to track progress, but they won't be required.)</li>

          <h3>How Are You Making Money Off This?</h3>
          <p>The short answer: I'm not. And, I won't.</p>
          <p>This is not a money making veture. I'm doing this because I love programming. It's been a joy and a career, and, in a very real way, I would have been lost without it. </p>

          <p>I'm up here standing on the shounders of giants.</p>
          <p>It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</p>

          <hr><br>
          <h3>Who's Paying For This?<br>Who Or What Is The Product?</h3>
          <p>There's a rule in the online and app world: if you aren't paying for a site or service, then you're the product. Business that give away their apps and services get paid behind the scenes from advertisers and marketers who are doing everything they can to get your to spend your money.</p>

          <p>This site is an exception to that rule.</p>

          <p>I'm paying for it myself. And, there's no product because this isn't a business. It's a labor of love.</p>

          <p>I've had dozens of converstaions with friends and family about this. It's always a struggle getting them to see where I'm coming from. All the messages in our society are about making money off whatever you can. To be doing something like this dones't make sense in that light. But, there are models: donating and volunteering. If it helps, think about what I'm doing as giving my time and money to a cause I believe in.</p>
          
          <p>This is me trying to make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>
            I&rsquo;m not sure how I ended up on the path, but I used to jump through a bunch of hoops to capture both STDOUT and STDERR from Python&rsquo;s subprocess modules. As of 3.7, it&rsquo;s straight forward with the capture_output. It&rsquo;s as easy as:
response = subprocess.run(['PROCESS_TO_RUN'], capture_output=True) The values are in:
response.stdoutandresponse.stderr The values are encoded and generally have a newline at the end of them. So you&rsquo;ll want to access them with something like:

            Picking up where we left off.
Got a PowerShell script setup that watches a specific folder and runs an ffmpeg command to process any gif files and place them in a new directory before deleting the original.
This was my first time using PowerShell to script something. It&rsquo;s very different from what I&rsquo;m used to, but I can see the appeal. Definitely going to take some getting used to.

            First off, you don&rsquo;t need all this to get started. It took me a year to put this together (not including all the stuff I had from my former life as a photographer). I got started with the built-in webcam. They&rsquo;re prefectly fine for getting up and running.
With that said, here&rsquo;s what my setup looks like as of January 2021:

I used GIF Brewery to make GIFs on my Mac. Since moving to Windows, I haven&rsquo;t found a good replacement&hellip; Until now.
In this session, I figure out how to get Adobe Premiere to setup the loop and then export an initial cropped file. Running that through ffmpeg give me a nice quality GIF at whatever size I specify.
