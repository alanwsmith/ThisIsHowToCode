                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>My name is Alan and this is my new project: A free, comprehensive education in computer programming.</p>
                <p>I going to build it piece by piece. Publishing each part as I go. It's a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Digital Garden</a> approach. One that will grow and adapt as it progresses.</p>
                <p>I started it on Dec. 19th, 2020. Right now, I'm still figuring everything out.</p> 

                <p>You can sign up for the newsletter if you want to keep tabs. I'll send updates once a month. (No names required because I'm trying to track as little personal information as possible)

            Well, the camera works, but the Cam Link doesn&rsquo;t work for me. My computer can&rsquo;t process fast enough to use it at 4K. So, falling back to 1080&hellip; Bummer.
Here&rsquo;s a test at 1080 just make sure things work.
A little preview of a future session where I&rsquo;ll parse out datatime stamps from when files were created to add dates to the site files that are missing them.

            This is a test of the Elgato Cam Link.
 There&rsquo;s a Canon 90D plugged into it with Clean HDMI signal It was connected to my Early 2015 13&quot; MacBook Pro Obviously, the CPU can&rsquo;t keep up.  The Elgato site says you need a 4th generation i5 or better. That certainly wasn&rsquo;t clear on purchase.
I use a 4K60 Pro Mk. II for recording the desktop. It works great. I thought the Cam Link would work the same way, but that&rsquo;s not the case.

  Setup an IAM account for it.
  The account starts off in the SES sandbox. Filled out the form to get full access.
   Note there there&rsquo;s a follow up to this, there&rsquo;s more work that you have to do to get things working. It&rsquo;s not listed in the Mailblast docs, but probably should be as a heads up.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been exploring Premiere and After Effects and green screen keying. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress and have a couple more softboxes coming in to help even more. (Basically every post about green screen keying says get your light right or you&rsquo;re in for a world of hurt)
While thinking about the green screen and the new camera that&rsquo;s on the way I started thinking about camera angles. I&rsquo;ve already pushed my monitor farther away from me that I&rsquo;d normally use it so that I can enlarge the fonts to make them readable on small screens.

            Video Test 1  GoPro - 30fps OBS - 30fps  Won&rsquo;t really be using the GoPro. This is really more about practicing with the green screen lighting and keying.
  Everything looks pretty good. Need to do a little more on the color balance and on the edges. I&rsquo;ve got another set of soft boxes coming in to get more even light on the green screen which should help.

        <p>
            Dec. 6, 2020
Bought a new camera last night.
Unfortunately, my old Canon 5D Mk III doesn&rsquo;t do auto-focus during while shooting video. Also, it only shoot 1080p. I want 4K.
4K is overkill for what I&rsquo;m doing right now. But, I&rsquo;m thinking long term. Like 20 years long term. I want to get the best available now so that as tech progresses, it holds up as well as possible.
