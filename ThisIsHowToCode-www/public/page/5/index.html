          <p>My name is Alan. For twenty-five years I've used what I learned from other folks to build a successful career writing code. Now, it's time for me to give back. For the next twenty-five, I'm builing this site into a free, comprehensice way to learn how to code. </p>

            <h3>There's Nothing Here...</h3>
            <p>Well, not much. I started the site Dec. 19th, 2020. The reason you're seeing it so early (and with no instructional videos yet) is that I'm coding it in public. Showing what it's like to build a project like this from scratch. It's like a Digital Garden where I'm inviting you in while I'm still tilling the soil.</p>

          <h3>The First Video</h3>
          <p>This first video isn't instructdional. </p>
          <p>There are going to be a few differetn types of videos: Fundamentals, Tutorials, How-Tos, and Live Coding. Right now, all the videos are Live Coding showing me building the site and getting everything setup. This is the first vidoe in that series. </p>
          <p>This isn't the first instructual video. It's the first in the series where I show the behind the scenes of building the site. </p>
          <p>I didn't really mean it to be that much of an introduction, but that's what it turned into.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Everything here is 100% free.</li>
              <li>There won't be any ads. Ads may have their place, but it's not in education.</li>
              <li>There won't be invasive tracking. I'll collect some metrics to maintian the site but it will be as anonymous as possible.</li>
              <li>The content is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">licensed</a> so you can do pretty much anything you want with it except sell it.</li>
              <li>There will be no requirement to sign up. You can use the site completely anonymously with no hassle. (There will eventually be user accounts that make it easier to track progress, but they won't be required.)</li>

          <h3>How Are You Making Money Off This?</h3>
          <p>The short answer: I'm not. And, I won't.</p>
          <p>This is not a money making veture. I'm doing this because I love programming. It's been a joy and a career, and, in a very real way, I would have been lost without it. </p>

          <p>I'm up here standing on the shounders of giants.</p>
          <p>It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</p>

        <div class="px-2">
          <hr><br>
          <h3>Who's Paying For This?<br>Who Or What Is The Product?</h3>
          <p>There's a rule in the online and app world: if you aren't paying for a site or service, then you're the product. Business that give away their apps and services get paid behind the scenes from advertisers and marketers who are doing everything they can to get your to spend your money.</p>

          <p>This site is an exception to that rule.</p>

          <p>I'm paying for it myself. And, there's no product because this isn't a business. It's a labor of love.</p>

          <p>I've had dozens of converstaions with friends and family about this. It's always a struggle getting them to see where I'm coming from. All the messages in our society are about making money off whatever you can. To be doing something like this dones't make sense in that light. But, there are models: donating and volunteering. If it helps, think about what I'm doing as giving my time and money to a cause I believe in.</p>
          
          <p>This is me trying to make the world a better place.</p>

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            The Plan  Finish moving in content to be served by Hugo  The Result  Got stuck working with sub directories. Files wouldn&rsquo;t output where expected. Did some troubleshooting by switching Hugo to actually build the site with the plain hugo command instead of serving it from memory with hugo server. This let me look in the public directory at the files that were actually output. Finally figured out that if there&rsquo;s a subfolder that you want content rendered it, the folder above has to contain and _index.

            We got a web site live!
Well, it&rsquo;s just a page and it&rsquo;s not on the domain we want and it&rsquo;s not secure, but it&rsquo;s live!
We setup basic hosting on Amazon S3. The goal is to use CloudFront and that&rsquo;s where we started, but this turned out to be a good first step. A test just to make sure the pipes are working and to get us moving.
Next steps are in the next video.

        <p>
            Notes Amazon changes their web console all the time. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if things look different and you have to search for them a little.
The Plan  Get the site served via CloudFront over HTTPS.  The Details   Started off by showing where we left off with an S3 bucket being served out directly via it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Static website hosting&rdquo; option property. We turned that off since we only want traffic to be able to hit the bucket via CloudFront.

            Overview I registered the ThisIsHowYouProgram.com domain on Hover. I already had an account there and when I woke up at 3 in the morning with the idea for the site that&rsquo;s where I went.
But, I want to use Amazon&rsquo;s Route 53 service to manage the domain so that everything is in the AWS ecosystem. Route 53 is designed to work with CloudFront in a way that other systems can&rsquo;t (via an ALIAS record)

Solution The solution I ended up with was to combine the ls and awk commands. The ls command does the listing an sorting while the awk command parses the data down to just the columns I need.

  Strings: use actual string with those things that kids can put on things.
  Arrays: Use a tube and put letters in there.
 use the number blocks that start with zero so you can talk about how many spots to move    Integers vs Floats
toast, where you have a toaster that only does full pieces of toast vs toaster over than can do parts - then photoshop one that can do huge numbers
