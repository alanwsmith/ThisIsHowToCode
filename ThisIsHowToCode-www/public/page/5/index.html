          <h3>Hi there!</h3>
          <p>My name is Alan. For the past twenty years I've had a successful career writing code based on what I learned from the folks who came before me. For the next twenty, it's time to give back. This site is how I'm doing that. Building it into a free, comprehensive education in computer programming.</p>

            <h3>There's Nothing Here...</h3>
            <p>Well, not much. I started the site Dec. 19th, 2020. The reason you're seeing it so early (and with no instructional videos yet) is that I'm coding it in public. Showing what it's like to build a project like this from scratch. It's like a Digital Garden where I'm inviting you in while I'm still tilling the soil.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Everything here is 100% free.</li>
              <li>There won't be any ads. Ads may have their place, but it's not in education.</li>
              <li>There won't be invasive tracking. I'll collect some metrics to maintian the site but it will be as anonymous as possible.</li>
              <li>The content is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">licensed</a> so you can do pretty much anything you want with it except sell it.</li>
              <li>There will be no requirement to sign up. You can use the site completely anonymously with no hassle. (There will eventually be user accounts that make it easier to track progress, but they won't be required.)</li>

          <h3>How Are You Making Money Off This?</h3>
          <p>The short answer: I'm not. And, I won't.</p>
          <p>This is not a money making veture. I'm doing this because I love programming. It's been a joy and a career, and, in a very real way, I would have been lost without it. </p>

          <p>I'm up here standing on the shounders of giants.</p>
          <p>It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</p>

          <h3>Who's Paying For This?<br>Who Or What Is The Product?</h3>
          <p>There's a rule in the online and app world: if you aren't paying for a site or service, then you're the product. Business that give away their apps and services get paid behind the scenes from advertisers and marketers who are doing everything they can to get your to spend your money.</p>

          <p>This site is an exception to that rule.</p>

          <p>I'm paying for it myself. And, there's no product because this isn't a business. It's a labor of love.</p>

          <p>I've had dozens of converstaions with friends and family about this. It's always a struggle getting them to see where I'm coming from. All the messages in our society are about making money off whatever you can. To be doing something like this dones't make sense in that light. But, there are models: donating and volunteering. If it helps, think about what I'm doing as giving my time and money to a cause I believe in.</p>
          
          <p>This is me trying to make the world a better place.</p>

          <p>This isn't the first instructual video. It's the first in the series where I show the behind the scenes of building the site. </p>
          <p>I didn't really mean it to be that much of an introduction, but that's what it turned into.</p>

        <p>
            This is our JavaScript Timer. It&rsquo;s what I use to keep track of time when recording videos. The basic details are:
 The timer starts when the page is opened The number displayed only updates every 300 seconds (which is 5 minutes) The way we do this is by using the % operator. It gives us the remainder of one number divided by another. Using this, we can see when the remainder of our target number is zero and know that we hit something that divides by it directly.

I missed changing the ids for the checkboxes and the labels the first time through. Oops. I caught it when I started to use the checklist. So, there&rsquo;s a quick addendum showing where I goofed and the fix.

The first thing to setup is a &ldquo;Root&rdquo; account. It has the power to do everything. It is THE main account. Because it&rsquo;s so powerful, you actually don&rsquo;t use it for much. Instead you create other user accounts in the AWS Identity and Access Management (also know as IAM) service and use them.

        <p>
            In This Episode Started out by talking a little about what Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is and why you&rsquo;d want to use it.
Added MFA to the web console user which was no problem.
Adding it to the CLI user turned into more of a trick. I thought all you had to do was assign MFA to a programatic access user and it would be enforced, but that&rsquo;s not the case. The Access Key and Secret Key still work just fine.
