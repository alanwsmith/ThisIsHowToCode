                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>My name is Alan and this is my new project: A free, comprehensive education in computer programming.</p>
                <p>I going to build it piece by piece. Publishing each part as I go. It's a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Digital Garden</a> approach. One that will grow and adapt as it progresses.</p>
                <p>I started it on Dec. 19th, 2020. Right now, I'm still figuring everything out.</p> 

                <p>You can sign up for the newsletter if you want to keep tabs. I'll send updates once a month. (No names required because I'm trying to track as little personal information as possible)

                    <li>This site will not have ads. Ads may have their place, but it's not in education.</li>
                    <li>This site won't have invasive tracking. There will be some analytics, but only so I can monitor the site's performance. It'll all be anonymous.</li>
                    <li>The content will be licensed in an open source way that will let anyone use it.</li>
                    <li>There will be no requirement to sign up. You can use the site completely anonymously and with no hassle. (There will eventually be user accounts that make it easier to track progress, but they won't be required.)</li>
                    <li>This is in no way a money making venture. I'm building this because I love programming and in a very real way I would have been lost without it. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</li>

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            In this one I build a little vanilla javascript function to launch my timer window from a link. I can control the size and position of the window to fit just my timer and put it where I want on the screen.
I start off with a button and then move to an &lt;a&gt; anchor tag. While doing the anchor tag I discovered I couldn&rsquo;t pass parameters to a function called by addEventListener.

        <p>
            The Plan  Finish moving in content to be served by Hugo  The Result  Got stuck working with sub directories. Files wouldn&rsquo;t output where expected. Did some troubleshooting by switching Hugo to actually build the site with the plain hugo command instead of serving it from memory with hugo server. This let me look in the public directory at the files that were actually output. Finally figured out that if there&rsquo;s a subfolder that you want content rendered it, the folder above has to contain and _index.

            We got a web site live!
Well, it&rsquo;s just a page and it&rsquo;s not on the domain we want and it&rsquo;s not secure, but it&rsquo;s live!
We setup basic hosting on Amazon S3. The goal is to use CloudFront and that&rsquo;s where we started, but this turned out to be a good first step. A test just to make sure the pipes are working and to get us moving.
Next steps are in the next video.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            Notes Amazon changes their web console all the time. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if things look different and you have to search for them a little.
The Plan  Get the site served via CloudFront over HTTPS.  The Details   Started off by showing where we left off with an S3 bucket being served out directly via it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Static website hosting&rdquo; option property. We turned that off since we only want traffic to be able to hit the bucket via CloudFront.

But, I want to use Amazon&rsquo;s Route 53 service to manage the domain so that everything is in the AWS ecosystem. Route 53 is designed to work with CloudFront in a way that other systems can&rsquo;t (via an ALIAS record)

  Details Up to this point, I&rsquo;ve been calling this project. This Is How You Program. Recording on of the episodes, I said &ldquo;This Is How You Code&rdquo; and immediately realized that&rsquo;s a better name.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            Goal I&rsquo;ve got 1,142 sample video files with various compressions settings that I built with an automatic Handbrake script. The files show up sorted by name, but I want them sorted by size to get a better idea of which ones I should look at.
Solution The solution I ended up with was to combine the ls and awk commands. The ls command does the listing an sorting while the awk command parses the data down to just the columns I need.
