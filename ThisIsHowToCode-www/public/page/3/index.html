          <p>My name is Alan. For twenty-five years I've used what I learned from other folks to build a successful career writing code. Now, it's time for me to give back. For the next twenty-five, I'm builing this site into a free, comprehensice way to learn how to code. </p>

            <h3>There's Nothing Here...</h3>
            <p>Well, not much. I started the site Dec. 19th, 2020. The reason you're seeing it so early (and with no instructional videos yet) is that I'm coding it in public. Showing what it's like to build a project like this from scratch. It's like a Digital Garden where I'm inviting you in while I'm still tilling the soil.</p>

          <h3>The First Video</h3>
          <p>This first video isn't instructdional. </p>
          <p>There are going to be a few differetn types of videos: Fundamentals, Tutorials, How-Tos, and Live Coding. Right now, all the videos are Live Coding showing me building the site and getting everything setup. This is the first vidoe in that series. </p>
          <p>This isn't the first instructual video. It's the first in the series where I show the behind the scenes of building the site. </p>
          <p>I didn't really mean it to be that much of an introduction, but that's what it turned into.</p>

          <h3>How Are You Making Money Off This?</h3>
          <p>The short answer: I'm not. And, I won't.</p>
          <p>This is not a money making veture. I'm doing this because I love programming. It's been a joy and a career, and, in a very real way, I would have been lost without it. </p>

          <p>I'm up here standing on the shounders of giants.</p>
          <p>It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</p>

          <h3>Who's Paying For This?<br>Who Or What Is The Product?</h3>
          <p>There's a rule in the online and app world: if you aren't paying for a site or service, then you're the product. Business that give away their apps and services get paid behind the scenes from advertisers and marketers who are doing everything they can to get your to spend your money.</p>

          <p>This site is an exception to that rule.</p>

          <p>I'm paying for it myself. And, there's no product because this isn't a business. It's a labor of love.</p>

          <p>I've had dozens of converstaions with friends and family about this. It's always a struggle getting them to see where I'm coming from. All the messages in our society are about making money off whatever you can. To be doing something like this dones't make sense in that light. But, there are models: donating and volunteering. If it helps, think about what I'm doing as giving my time and money to a cause I believe in.</p>
          
          <p>This is me trying to make the world a better place.</p>

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            This is a test of the Elgato Cam Link.
 There&rsquo;s a Canon 90D plugged into it with Clean HDMI signal It was connected to my Early 2015 13&quot; MacBook Pro Obviously, the CPU can&rsquo;t keep up.  The Elgato site says you need a 4th generation i5 or better. That certainly wasn&rsquo;t clear on purchase.
I use a 4K60 Pro Mk. II for recording the desktop. It works great. I thought the Cam Link would work the same way, but that&rsquo;s not the case.

  Setup an IAM account for it.
  The account starts off in the SES sandbox. Filled out the form to get full access.
   Note there there&rsquo;s a follow up to this, there&rsquo;s more work that you have to do to get things working. It&rsquo;s not listed in the Mailblast docs, but probably should be as a heads up.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been exploring Premiere and After Effects and green screen keying. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress and have a couple more softboxes coming in to help even more. (Basically every post about green screen keying says get your light right or you&rsquo;re in for a world of hurt)
While thinking about the green screen and the new camera that&rsquo;s on the way I started thinking about camera angles. I&rsquo;ve already pushed my monitor farther away from me that I&rsquo;d normally use it so that I can enlarge the fonts to make them readable on small screens.

            Video Test 1  GoPro - 30fps OBS - 30fps  Won&rsquo;t really be using the GoPro. This is really more about practicing with the green screen lighting and keying.
  Everything looks pretty good. Need to do a little more on the color balance and on the edges. I&rsquo;ve got another set of soft boxes coming in to get more even light on the green screen which should help.

        <p>
            Dec. 6, 2020
Bought a new camera last night.
Unfortunately, my old Canon 5D Mk III doesn&rsquo;t do auto-focus during while shooting video. Also, it only shoot 1080p. I want 4K.
4K is overkill for what I&rsquo;m doing right now. But, I&rsquo;m thinking long term. Like 20 years long term. I want to get the best available now so that as tech progresses, it holds up as well as possible.

            Things I&rsquo;ve done for the setup:
  System Preferences -&gt; Display -&gt; Cursor Size = up about halfway. see screenshot
  VS Code:
 Window: Zoom Level = 3 Editor: Font Family = Menlo, Monaco, &lsquo;Courier New&rsquo;, monospace Editor: Font Size = 15 Editor: Line Height = 19  This enlarges the entire UI to make it easier to read.
Also updated the theme font to make it pure black.

Warning - Inelegant Code Ahead This is not elegant code. Except for one function at the top, it&rsquo;s one big procedure from top to bottom. Coding is keeping context in your head. That&rsquo;s harder to do when things aren&rsquo;t broken into parts. This script is riiiight at the limit for me being able to hang-on to the entire thing.
This also isn&rsquo;t how I code most of the time.
