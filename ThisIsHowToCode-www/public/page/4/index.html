                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>My name is Alan and this is my new project: A free, comprehensive education in computer programming.</p>
                <p>I going to build it piece by piece. Publishing each part as I go. It's a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Digital Garden</a> approach. One that will grow and adapt as it progresses.</p>
                <p>I started it on Dec. 19th, 2020. Right now, I'm still figuring everything out.</p> 

                <p>You can sign up for the newsletter if you want to keep tabs. I'll send updates once a month. (No names required because I'm trying to track as little personal information as possible)

                    <li>This site will not have ads. Ads may have their place, but it's not in education.</li>
                    <li>This site won't have invasive tracking. There will be some analytics, but only so I can monitor the site's performance. It'll all be anonymous.</li>
                    <li>The content will be licensed in an open source way that will let anyone use it.</li>
                    <li>There will be no requirement to sign up. You can use the site completely anonymously and with no hassle. (There will eventually be user accounts that make it easier to track progress, but they won't be required.)</li>
                    <li>This is in no way a money making venture. I'm building this because I love programming and in a very real way I would have been lost without it. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</li>

        <p>
            This is our JavaScript Timer. It&rsquo;s what I use to keep track of time when recording videos. The basic details are:
 The timer starts when the page is opened The number displayed only updates every 300 seconds (which is 5 minutes) The way we do this is by using the % operator. It gives us the remainder of one number divided by another. Using this, we can see when the remainder of our target number is zero and know that we hit something that divides by it directly.

Notes I mentioned radio buttons but forgot to talk about them. Here&rsquo;s another video that talks about the difference (TKTKTKTK radio buttons vs checkboxes).
I missed changing the ids for the checkboxes and the labels the first time through. Oops. I caught it when I started to use the checklist. So, there&rsquo;s a quick addendum showing where I goofed and the fix.

        <p>
            Overview This video is about getting started with an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account. You&rsquo;ll need a credit card, phone number, and email address.
The first thing to setup is a &ldquo;Root&rdquo; account. It has the power to do everything. It is THE main account. Because it&rsquo;s so powerful, you actually don&rsquo;t use it for much. Instead you create other user accounts in the AWS Identity and Access Management (also know as IAM) service and use them.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            In This Episode Started out by talking a little about what Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is and why you&rsquo;d want to use it.
Added MFA to the web console user which was no problem.
Adding it to the CLI user turned into more of a trick. I thought all you had to do was assign MFA to a programatic access user and it would be enforced, but that&rsquo;s not the case. The Access Key and Secret Key still work just fine.

            If your domain is registered on another site, that&rsquo;s fine. You can send over the name server and then decide if you want to transfer to Route 53.

  There are two ways to setup.
