          <p>My name is Alan. For twenty-five years I've used what I learned from other folks to build a successful career writing code. Now, it's time for me to give back. For the next twenty-five, I'm builing this site into a free, comprehensice way to learn how to code. </p>

            <h3>There's Nothing Here...</h3>
            <p>Well, not much. I started the site Dec. 19th, 2020. The reason you're seeing it so early (and with no instructional videos yet) is that I'm coding it in public. Showing what it's like to build a project like this from scratch. It's like a Digital Garden where I'm inviting you in while I'm still tilling the soil.</p>

          <h3>The First Video</h3>
          <p>This first video isn't instructdional. </p>
          <p>There are going to be a few differetn types of videos: Fundamentals, Tutorials, How-Tos, and Live Coding. Right now, all the videos are Live Coding showing me building the site and getting everything setup. This is the first vidoe in that series. </p>
          <p>This isn't the first instructual video. It's the first in the series where I show the behind the scenes of building the site. </p>
          <p>I didn't really mean it to be that much of an introduction, but that's what it turned into.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Everything here is 100% free.</li>
              <li>There won't be any ads. Ads may have their place, but it's not in education.</li>
              <li>There won't be invasive tracking. I'll collect some metrics to maintian the site but it will be as anonymous as possible.</li>
              <li>The content is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">licensed</a> so you can do pretty much anything you want with it except sell it.</li>
              <li>There will be no requirement to sign up. You can use the site completely anonymously with no hassle. (There will eventually be user accounts that make it easier to track progress, but they won't be required.)</li>

          <h3>How Are You Making Money Off This?</h3>
          <p>The short answer: I'm not. And, I won't.</p>
          <p>This is not a money making veture. I'm doing this because I love programming. It's been a joy and a career, and, in a very real way, I would have been lost without it. </p>

          <p>I'm up here standing on the shounders of giants.</p>
          <p>It's my duty and my calling to help others up.</p>

          <h3>Who's Paying For This?<br>Who Or What Is The Product?</h3>
          <p>There's a rule in the online and app world: if you aren't paying for a site or service, then you're the product. Business that give away their apps and services get paid behind the scenes from advertisers and marketers who are doing everything they can to get your to spend your money.</p>

          <p>This site is an exception to that rule.</p>

          <p>I'm paying for it myself. And, there's no product because this isn't a business. It's a labor of love.</p>

          <p>I've had dozens of converstaions with friends and family about this. It's always a struggle getting them to see where I'm coming from. All the messages in our society are about making money off whatever you can. To be doing something like this dones't make sense in that light. But, there are models: donating and volunteering. If it helps, think about what I'm doing as giving my time and money to a cause I believe in.</p>
          
          <p>This is me trying to make the world a better place.</p>

            Overview Started to build the deployer in the last session but found an issue where links weren&rsquo;t working. Now that that&rsquo;s solved, it&rsquo;s back to the deployer.
 EDIT: Points about 10:40 and some beffore when it showed the Access Key. Check all termial hits.
Make sure to edit out when you fire up keychain access.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>
        <p>
            Started off by building a deployer but then discovered our index.html files weren&rsquo;t showing up. Fix is a Lambda@Edge function that looks for calls that need to add the files and adds them.
Was thinking about trying to remove the trailing slashes, but that&rsquo;s begging for problems. Also, realized that it would take hacking Hugo itself to deal with removing the slashes since it puts them in the URLs when it makes them.
