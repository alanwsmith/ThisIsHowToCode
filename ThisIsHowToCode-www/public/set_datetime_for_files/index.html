		<p>I decided when I first started the site that I didn&rsquo;t want dates and times to show up. I&rsquo;ll note when stuff is time sensative and keep things up to date, but dates themselves are a distraction. (I feel the same way about my blog which is why I only do the month and year for them)</p>
<p>Anyway, I figure out that I can use epoch timestamps for the dates. I&rsquo;m not trying to hide the dates, just obfuscate them and that does a great job.</p>
<p>The trick is that I made a whole bunhc of posts without dates in the YAML front matter. The good news is that I can still figure out when the dates are.</p>
<p>I ran this command on my mac to pull the <code>stat</code> data for each file in the content directory.</p>
<pre><code>find . -name '*.md' -exec stat {} +
</code></pre>
<p>It finds all the <code>.md</code> (markdown) files and runs <code>stat</code> on them. That command outputs some details including (TKTKTK I think it&rsquo;s when the inode was created, but need to verify) the TKTKTK timestamp that I can use.</p>
<p>Now, all I need to do is turn those timestamps into epoch time format and insert them into the files.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll make a good project.</p>
<p>(Look in the <code>output_from_find.txt</code> for the data to work with)</p>
<p>NOTE: I&rsquo;m not sure if those are all accurate. Another source to look at is the Videos. Not sure about the timestamps, but the filenames are generally date/time strings.</p>
